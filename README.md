<h1> The purpose of my project is to study the DAX40 in a succession of "pyramidal" steps.</h1>
<img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="AjOR.gif">
<h3>First of all, a classic study of its characteristics, history and main metrics is required.
Afterwards I base my analysis and my trading/investment strategies on the following postulates: 
I analyze the market, its characteristics, history and key metrics. Then I carry out a macroeconomic analysis of its environment (GDP, unemployment, CPI, etc.). 
Then, I analyze the national, European and wrold sentiment data to determine the bullish or bearish bias in line with my previous economic analysis. 
Once I've determined my bias, I look for an entry point via technical analysis and in line with the technical analysis, I set-up the entry with the best possible timing.
Finally, once all my parameters have been calculated and mastered, I analyze the risk/reward to determine whether it's worth entering the market.</h3>
