- First of all, a classic study of its characteristics, history and main metrics is required.

- Afterwards I base my analysis and my trading/investment strategies on the following postulates: 
I analyze the market, its characteristics, history and key metrics. Then I carry out a macroeconomic analysis of its environment (GDP, unemployment, IPC, etc.). 
- Then, I analyze the national, European and world sentiment data to determine the bullish or bearish bias in line with my previous economic analysis.

- Once I've determined my bias, I look for an entry point via technical analysis and in line with the technical analysis, I set-up the entry with the best possible timing.

- Finally, once all my parameters have been calculated and mastered, I analyze the risk/reward to determine whether it's worth entering in the market.
